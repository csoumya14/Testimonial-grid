They were very hands-on and I never\n          had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.\n          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,\n          I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
